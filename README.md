# Z3.LinqBinding
LINQ to Z3 - an esoteric LINQ binding based on Bart De Smet's idea

## Original Idea
In 2009 Bart De Smet created a LINQ to Z3 binding and describes it in three blog posts
* [EXPLORING THE Z3 THEOREM PROVER (WITH A BIT OF LINQ)](http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2009/04/15/exploring-the-z3-theorem-prover-with-a-bit-of-linq.aspx)
* [LINQ TO Z3 – THEOREM SOLVING ON STEROIDS – PART 0](http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2009/04/19/linq-to-z3-theorem-solving-on-steroids-part-0.aspx)
* [LINQ TO Z3 – THEOREM SOLVING ON STEROIDS – PART 1](http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2009/09/27/linq-to-z3-theorem-solving-on-steroids-part-1.aspx)

## This Version
Since 2009 the Z3 Theorem Prover, initial from Microsoft Research, has changed:
* new API versions with a lot breaking changes
* in March 2015 the licence has moved to MIT License and the source code to GitHub: https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3

This version of **Z3.LinqBinding** supports Z3 4.4.0.<br/>
Also the sample code of a Sudoku theorem extension has been added: **Z3.LinqBinding.Sudoku**
